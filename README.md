# Car Price Prediction using Linear and Polynomial Regression

This beginner-friendly machine learning project walks through the process of predicting car prices based on features like engine size, horsepower, and mileage. You’ll get hands-on experience with data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and regression modeling — all using Python and essential ML libraries.

## Dataset
The dataset used is the **CarPrice_Assignment.csv**, which includes technical specifications and price details for various car models.

## Project Steps
- Data Loading & Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Linear Regression Modeling
- Polynomial Regression Modeling
- Model Evaluation & Comparison

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Output
The project builds two regression models and compares their performance on the task of predicting car prices. Polynomial regression showed better results due to its ability to model non-linear patterns.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure the `CarPrice_Assignment.csv` file is in the same directory.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`GIT_01.ipynb`) and run the cells step by step.
